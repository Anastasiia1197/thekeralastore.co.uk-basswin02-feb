            <h1>Cookie Policy – Designed with UK Players in Mind</h1>
            <p class="txt">
                This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>Basswin Casino UK</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") uses
                cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website at
                <strong>https://thekeralastore.co.uk/</strong>. Our primary goal is to provide our players in the United
                Kingdom with a seamless, secure, and personalized gaming experience while upholding the highest
                standards of data privacy and transparency. By understanding and using these technologies responsibly,
                we can enhance site functionality, analyse traffic patterns, and deliver relevant content. This policy
                is an integral part of our broader Privacy Policy and should be read in conjunction with it.
            </p>

            <h2>How Cookies Enhance Your Gaming Experience</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                Cookies are small text files placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit
                our site. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently and provide valuable operational
                insights. On the Basswin UK platform, cookies enable essential functions such as maintaining your secure
                logged-in session during play, remembering your game preferences and language settings (e.g., GBP
                currency display), and keeping your bonus selections intact during the claim process. Without certain
                cookies, core features of our website would not operate correctly, impacting your user experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Data We Collect and Our Commitment to Responsible Use</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                The data collected via cookies is used strictly to improve your experience and our service quality for
                players across Great Britain. This includes non-personally identifiable information such as IP address
                (anonymised where possible), browser type, device characteristics, pages visited, session duration, and
                referral sources. We use this aggregated data to understand how our site is used by our UK audience,
                identify areas for technical improvement, optimise game performance, and ensure our promotions are
                relevant. We do not use cookies to collect sensitive personal information without your explicit consent.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services: Ensuring Safe and Transparent Partnerships</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                We work with reputable third-party service providers who may set cookies on our behalf. These partners
                assist us with critical functions such as website analytics (e.g., Google Analytics), performance
                monitoring, fraud prevention crucial for a secure UK gaming environment, and advertising campaign
                measurement. These third parties are contractually bound to use the information only for the purposes we
                have specified and in accordance with UK data protection laws, including the UK GDPR. Their privacy
                policies are available on their respective websites, and we encourage you to review them.
            </p>
