            <p class="txt">
                This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>https://www.benchtop.co.nz/</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") uses
                cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website. Our primary goal is to provide you
                with a seamless, secure, and personalized online experience while maintaining the highest standards of
                data privacy and transparency. By understanding and using these technologies responsibly, we can enhance
                site functionality, analyze traffic patterns, and deliver relevant content. This policy is an integral
                part of our broader Privacy Policy and should be read in conjunction with it.
            </p>

            <h2>Unlocking better experiences: How cookies work</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you
                visit our website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide valuable
                information to the site owners. On our platform, cookies enable essential functions such as maintaining
                your logged-in session, remembering your game preferences and language settings, and keeping items in
                your virtual cart during a bonus claim process. Without certain cookies, core features of the website
                would not operate correctly.
            </p>

            <h2>Data we collect and our strict commitment to responsible use</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                The data collected via cookies is used strictly to improve your user experience and the overall quality
                of our service. This may include non-personally identifiable information such as IP address, browser
                type, device characteristics, pages visited, time spent on pages, and referral sources. We use this
                aggregated data to understand how our site is used, identify areas for technical improvement, and ensure
                our promotional content is relevant to our New Zealand audience. We do not use cookies to collect
                sensitive personal information without your explicit consent.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-party services: Ensuring safe and transparent tracking</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                We engage with reputable third-party service providers who may also set cookies on our behalf. These
                partners assist us with critical functions such as website analytics (e.g., Google Analytics),
                performance monitoring, fraud prevention, and advertising campaign measurement. These third parties are
                contractually bound to use the information only for the purposes we have specified and in accordance
                with applicable data protection laws. Their privacy policies are available on their respective websites,
                and we encourage you to review them.
            </p>

            <h2>Take control: How to customize your cookie preferences easily</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                You have full control over the use of cookies. Most web browsers allow you to manage your cookie
                preferences through their settings. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies, to accept cookies
                only from trusted sites, or to alert you each time a website tries to place a cookie. You can also
                delete cookies that have already been stored on your device. Please be aware that if you choose to
                disable or block certain cookies, some features of <strong>https://www.benchtop.co.nz/</strong> may not
                function properly, and your user experience may be impacted. For detailed instructions on managing
                cookies, please consult your browser's "Help" section.

            <h2>Always informed: Updates to our policy and how to reach us</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                This Cookie Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in technology, regulation, or our
                services. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We recommend checking
