            <p class="txt">
                This User Agreement ("Terms") constitutes a legally binding contract between you ("User", "Player") and
                the operator of <strong>Basswin Casino UK</strong>, accessible via
                <strong>https://thekeralastore.co.uk/</strong>. By accessing, registering, or using any services offered
                on this website, you explicitly agree to comply with and be bound by all terms, conditions, policies,
                and notices stated herein. These Terms are designed to establish a safe, transparent, and fair
                environment for all participants in accordance with our UK Gambling Commission license. It is your
                responsibility to read and understand them in full. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you
                must immediately cease using our services.
            </p>

            <h2>How to access and responsibly use Basswin Casino UK services</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                Access to our services is granted solely for personal, non-commercial entertainment purposes. You agree
                to use the website and its features, including games, bonuses, and account management tools, responsibly
                and in accordance with these Terms and all applicable laws in the United Kingdom. This includes
                providing accurate and truthful information during registration, maintaining the confidentiality of your
                account credentials, and promptly updating your details if they change. You are solely responsible for
                all activities conducted under your account.
            </p>

            <h2>Strict age verification and legal compliance policies</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                Our services are strictly intended for individuals who have reached the legal age for gambling in their
                jurisdiction. In Great Britain, the minimum legal age is 18 years. By registering an account, you
                represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. We are required by our UKGC license to verify
                your age and identity, and we reserve the right to request documentation (e.g., passport, driving
                licence, utility bill) at any time. Failure to provide satisfactory proof of age or identity will result
                in immediate account suspension and forfeiture of any funds. It is your obligation to ensure that online
                gambling is legal in your specific location within the UK.
            </p>

                update these Terms at our sole discretion at any time to reflect changes in our services, legal
                requirements, or regulatory guidance from the UK Gambling Commission. Continued use of the website
                following the posting of any changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes. It is your
                responsibility to periodically review this page for updates. The most current version of the Terms will
                always be available at this URL.

                You agree to use our services in a lawful, respectful, and fair manner. You must not engage in any
                activity that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the website or interfere with any other

            <p class="txt">
                The following activities are strictly prohibited and constitute a material breach of these Terms:

                vulnerabilities, participating under multiple accounts (including to claim multiple bonuses), and any
                attempt to circumvent our security, bonus, or promotional rules. We employ sophisticated monitoring
                systems to detect such activities. Violations will lead to immediate account termination, forfeiture of
                all funds (including deposits), and may be reported to relevant authorities, including the UKGC.
            </p>

            <h2>Transparency on third-party links and external content</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                Our website may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by
                us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
                practices of any third-party sites. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or
                liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused by or in connection with the use of any

                sites you visit.

            <h2>Clear policies on account suspension and termination</h2>
            <p class="txt">
                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any current or future use of the
                service, for any reason, at our sole discretion, without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited
                to, breaches of these Terms, suspicious activity, failure to pass age/identity verification, or to
                comply with regulatory requirements from the UK Gambling Commission. Upon termination, your right to use
                the service ceases immediately. If your account is terminated due to a breach, any bonus funds, winnings
                from bonuses, or remaining balance may be forfeited.

            <h2>Defining liability, legal obligations, and disclaimers</h2>

                your use of the service is limited to the amount of funds you have deposited via the website. We are not
                liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of

                demand made by any third party due to your breach of these Terms or your violation of any law or the
                rights of a third party.

                resolution. Most concerns can be resolved efficiently in this manner. If a dispute cannot be resolved
                informally, you may refer it to the UK Gambling Commission's Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
                service, details of which are available on our website. These Terms are governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Any legal proceedings shall be subject to the exclusive
